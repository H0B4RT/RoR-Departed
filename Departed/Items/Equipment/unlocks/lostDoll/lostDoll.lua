Order Details:

Get this out of my house. Please. Just take it.

Since I've received this god-forsaken thing, my husband has fallen down the stairs and broke his neck, my son got hit by a bus, and my daughter has drowned in the bathtub. And.. oh god.. I swear it moves around the house. I've tried leaving it locked in a safe, and it will be out the next day. It wont burn. Cutting it has resulted in the amputation of both my arms.


Please..
