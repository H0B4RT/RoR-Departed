Order Details:

Here's a replacement for your damaged equipment. Crazy how gang activity is starting up again - even crazier that they'd steal a capacitor from you guys. 

Anyway, you guys know the drill - make sure to routinely discharge the capacitor's storage cells, as it may hold on to latent voltage. Oh, and make sure to not point it at anybody when you do.
