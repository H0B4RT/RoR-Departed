Thqwib
Key Notes
	- BASE CONTENT
	- So... Thqwib was kinda reworked. It still does the 30 thqwibs, but one of the coolest changes from RoR2 to the thqwibs was the fact that thqwibs trigger on kill effects. As such, that has been added but the cooldown increased. May be increased further down the line.

Unlock: If it is an unlock.

Order Details:

Thqwibs naturally live in very low atmosphere, so the pressurized container is for their own safety. If released into the room, they'll die immediately, so don't.

I included approximately 30 thqwibs; despite their similar appearance to other creatures, they are naturally social and will become depressed if left alone.
