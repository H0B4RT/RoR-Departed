Order Details:

Strange artifact. Seems to be made of nano-technology, allowing it to solidify and liquify at will. I have yet to find a lock this key cannot open. Highly Illegal I imagine..

Has opened traditional lock and bolt, card readers, eye scanners, dead bolts, chains, zippers, and my phone password.
I expect a hefty sum for this, because otherwise.. well.. your guild will simply become obsolete because of one key.
