Order Details:

Should help in holding choke positions without losing so many men. I know that hercules is simply held because of pride; we've blown any resources we could've mined into the stratosphere by now.

Just simply lay it down and its smart-fire should prevent it from blowing your own legs off. Spits out about six. Realize that it takes about.. 45 seconds to reload the minelayer and about a second to arm.
