Order Details:

Another one for you folks. You liked the previous shipment so much, I thought I would send you more outdated tech. When I say outdated, I MEAN outdated. This thing triggers from plunging; while it still uses microwave signals to connect between sticks of dynamite, it is otherwise the same as the classics.
