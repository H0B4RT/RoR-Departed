Order Details:

Carrara marble is very hard to find these days. It's been very popular since Ancient Rome; however, most deposits ran out, so a chunk of Carrara marble marks up a pretty price. I'm thinking $800,000 for the amount I'm offering.

You can make those sculptures you've always dreamed of.
