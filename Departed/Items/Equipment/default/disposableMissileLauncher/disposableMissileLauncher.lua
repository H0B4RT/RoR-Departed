Order Details:

So here is a prototype of the disposable missile launcher you requested. The box itself is made of cardboard, which raises some safety issues but also lowers the production costs immensely. The missiles are also the dumb ones that didn't pass inspection the first time around, allowing us to fit sixteen into this!

The entire thing costs about.. $40. Make sure that you don't store them together; some of the rounds have been observed to explode by themselves.
