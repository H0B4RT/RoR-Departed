Order Details:

This is the droid head for the model ER-14 that you requested. Fully functional, it just rewuires Wiring.

These are quite difficult to obtain these days, given the whole RaCom controversy.

Don't forget to disable the security protocols before hnadling, I don't think you want a hundred backup drones around your shop!

If you need any tools or pieces let me know.
