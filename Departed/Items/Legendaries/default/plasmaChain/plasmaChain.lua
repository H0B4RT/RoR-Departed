Hey there, my wife and I am returning a lost plasma chain. It is still fully operational and can haul my spaceship easily, so we expect the full reward!

We found it in an unmarked cave with a very large claw wrapped around it. The serial number should tell you the previous owner; the finder's fee can be sent to the same account that I'm sending this message from. Thank you.
