Order Details:

Very interesting sample. Found in the egg of an indigenous species in Sector 13. It undergoes mitosis that we all know, but at a much faster rate; about 2140x faster. Obviously can be useful for medicinal purposes.

Make sure to follow the instructions included to keep the sample alive. We have sent it frozen to stop the rapid duplications; since it increases in cell count exponentially, it could very well spiral out of control otherwise.
