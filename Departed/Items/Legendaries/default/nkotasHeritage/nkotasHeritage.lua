Order Details:

After Nkota's siblings attempted to get the heritage for themselves, someone stole the article in what seemed to be an act of vengeance. 

It only fell into my hands after a young man sold it for an adequate amount of money. I am sending you as you might be able to help me analyze it.

I am willing to sell it to a museum and give you a cut if it IS the authentic one.
