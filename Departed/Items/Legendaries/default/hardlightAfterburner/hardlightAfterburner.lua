Take this somewhere PRIVATE before opening. Don't let your wife see, don't even let your kids see. I know you're 'out of the business' but this is the biggest haul we've ever done. They called this thing a 'hard lightburner' or something, and it's suppose to be infinite fuel. I don't know, I couldn't understand them from up in the vents but CAN YOU IMAGINE? Gas prices have been through the roof since the spill in 2040, imagine how much cash you could make just rigging this thing up to your neighborhood for a little somethin'-somethin'! Anyway, they said it was wicked dangerous and to rig it to something stable, so chain it down or something.
