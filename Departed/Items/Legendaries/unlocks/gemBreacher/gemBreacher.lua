Order Details:

Your continued correspondence, as always, has been exceptionally helpful in our endeavor.

With our most recent prototype, the Mark 1, gem core stability is up by 16%, and our team estimates that number will double with our next model.

One major problem still remains: efficiency. Our facilities are no longer equipped to handle the electrical burden of this prototype. Furhter testing will have to be reserved for the Mark II.

For now, I've sent the Mark I as a keepsake, dedicated to your generosity, forgiveness, and - hopefully - continued support through grant.

Sincerely: Alex Deluca
