FORGET ALOE VERA. THIS IS THE NEXT THING.


You know how people always have those on their desks? Well this isn't just for the cuts and burns; this makes you feel good EVERYWHERE. Vitamins, proteins, you name it, this plant got it. Takes very little time for it to bear another fruit as well, but it does require some strange potting soil... as in carcasses. Small carcasses.


ANYWAYS, shoot me an email if you are interested!
