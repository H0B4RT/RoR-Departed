Order Details:

With how many rings he had, you would think more would have been found, eh? Nope, just this one. The King used to sacrifice one of his own sons to embue with dark spirits. He claimed that the spirits warded away any ill omen. The King lived until he was 104, so hey, maybe he was right.

As the last remaining Wicked ring, I expect a hefty sum.
