So you know the solar flare, from a few days ago? Well it destroyed the lower district, and I was on clean-up crew.

Found this scarf in the rubble, essentially untouched. All these dead bodies and strewn pieces, and this scarf is peeking out like some ----in flag. I know I shouldn't have taken it home, but I did. I.. feel safer with it. This thing survived that horrible day, it must be able to survive whatever I have to endure, right? Haha..
