Hey bud! Do you remember... summer of 2032, was it? The night with Alicia? Well, um, remember when we got waay too drunk and broke into the police station? Well, I still have those spikestrips from then. Haha, good times right?

The doctors say I don't have much time left. Since you're in the force now and all, I felt obligated to return it to you! Haha. So.. yeah. Hope you're doing well. It's been lonely here without you.
