Order Details:

Jesus, okay. The only reason I'm sending you guys another shipment is because of what you did for Shelby. Consider that debt paid.

Since you APPARENTLY didn't get my message the first time, I'll tell you again. See the orange end? Don't touch it. Once you take the wrapping off, the adhesive is ACTIVE. DON'T TOUCH IT. YOU STICK THAT END ON BAD THINGS, NOT YOURSELF.

The cadets? Those lives are on you, not me.
