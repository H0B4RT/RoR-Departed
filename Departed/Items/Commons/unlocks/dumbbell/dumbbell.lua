This artifact is the final piece of our collection, originating from a presumed interstellar object known as “Phytniss.” Despite weighing approximately 22 kilograms, it bears the engraving “50.” The reason for this discrepancy is unclear; it’s possible that the creators of this artifact had a different understanding of mathematics than we do today.
