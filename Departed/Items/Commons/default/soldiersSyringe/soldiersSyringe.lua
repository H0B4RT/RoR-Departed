Order Details:

Should help with multi-purpose requirements needed of soldiers. Contains vaccinations, antibiotics, pain killers, steroids, heroin, gasoline.. and something that feels like burning.
Use standard procedures for injections.. clean the area, sterilize, no air, give them a candy, etc.

Works for my boys, so no reason it shouldn't work for yours! The more shots the better; very few of my men have actually died from overdosing on it. Most just get sick.
