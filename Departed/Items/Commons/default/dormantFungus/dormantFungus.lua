Order Details:

When you commanded me to explore the fungal caves all I expected to find was... well, fungi, of course. Though I wasn't excited by any means, this specimen caught my eye.
It seems to only grow around flowing water, and ever since I collected and contained this sample, both the colouration and the smell faded out quickly.

I hope you can study it further.
