Order Details:

This egg seems to be somewhere between hatching and dying. Leaving it undisturbed usually causes it to wiggle around a bit, maybe sticking a tendril out. Trying to remove it from its shell is greeted by the most horrible screetching!

I can't bring it to myself to cook it alive. I don't know what to do with it, so here you go; maybe it will hatch in a warmer climate like yours. As useless as he is, I have grown a bit fond of him. Please take care!
