Order Details:

The strongest biological healing agent.. is a mushroom. Found in an abandoned house. I find some humor in that.
This fungus has developed an amazing defense mechanism of hiding underground when bothered, allowing it to live long enough to distribute spores.

Can be either ground into a paste or.. planted directly into the wound. A small warning; you'll feel it enter you, and it is every bit as unpleasant as it sounds.
