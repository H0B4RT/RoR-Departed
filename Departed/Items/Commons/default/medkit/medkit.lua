Order Details:

Alright, big shipment coming in. Each Medkit should contain bandages, sterile dressings, soap, antiseptics, saline, gloves, scissors, aspirin, codeine, and an Epipen. Should be a huge step up from what you had before, and should.. uh, prevent any future problems like last week.

Thanks.
