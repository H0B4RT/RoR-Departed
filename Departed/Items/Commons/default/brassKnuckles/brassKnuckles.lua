Order Details:

We found this at the crime scene. We need to check for DNA against the rest of the evidence.
I still can't believe they got away.
The back has some kind of symbol, maybe that could give us a clue. I'll be heading to the west of [REDACTED], I know someone who can help us solve the case.
