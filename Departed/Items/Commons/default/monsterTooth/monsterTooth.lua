Ripped it RIGHT out of 'is mouth! A big fight that one gave me, I tell ya! Wrestled me right down, jaws wrapped around my head! Good thing Bishop here got him with that vaporiser, eh? Hahaha!

It's been my good luck charm for a while, but hey, with the money you're payin' for it I'll give 'er up. Sometimes I feel like it helped me on hunts though, ya know? Like.. instincts.
