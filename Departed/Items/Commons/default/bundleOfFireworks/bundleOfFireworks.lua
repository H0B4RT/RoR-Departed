Yeah, celebration! Bought these from a friend, forgot where he said he got them. I'm glad that we finally re-legalized residential use of fireworks in 2054 after the... well, the terrorist attacks. Disguising homing missiles as fireworks? Don't ever quote me on it, but it was pretty smart. Anyways, these are for your kids to use. Have fun!
