Very very valuable. Don't drop it; it's worth more than you.

What is it? Well, are you blind? It's obviously a warbanner from the War of 2019 from one of the rebel groups. Yes, maybe a little overdramatic, but inspiring nonetheless. They say - they say that warbanners won the war for them. Gave them.. magical strength.
