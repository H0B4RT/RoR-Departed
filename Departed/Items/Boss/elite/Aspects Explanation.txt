So, Aspects are a full on thing in Departed.

If you have ever played RoR2 with Zet Aspects, you pretty much know how the aspects will work. 
Aspects have always been one of the cooler item concepts, so a lot of the aspects are visually based off of the SS1 aspects & DigBug's assistance.
They can be picked up as an Item or Equipment. When in the Equipment Slot, they act as 3 of the item in the inventory.
