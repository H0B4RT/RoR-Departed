Order Details:

Found by killing a... giant magma worm. Yes, you read that correctly. After it died, its body lay dormant but its eyes seem to still look around, watching. Removal of the eye showed that it may be a parasite that attaches to the worm itself; the worm grants it protection, while the eye gives it the vision it needs.
