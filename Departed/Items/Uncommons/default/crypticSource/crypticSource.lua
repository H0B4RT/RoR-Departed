Order Details:

From atoms to sentient beings, everything comes from energy. However, this rather cryptic object seems to emanate energy on its own. High amounts of friction seem to trigger a chain reaction which makes it highly unstable. However, it may also be a manipulable source of (infinite?) energy. Whether this will lead us to the utopian future we crave for is completely uncertain, but this completely changes our previous thoughts about the universe.
