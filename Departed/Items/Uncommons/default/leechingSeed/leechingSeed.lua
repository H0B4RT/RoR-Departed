Order Details:

These seeds are recently germinating, so be quick! These flesh-infesting pods seem to burrow, balloon, and then pop in a few months. Most test patients have.. died. However, before they die, they feel increased health and state of mind!
In fact, the pods themselves seem to develop spores, which if collected can be turned into a pain reliever..

Find a way to stop its growth cycle at that state, and you have yourself a great healing agent.
