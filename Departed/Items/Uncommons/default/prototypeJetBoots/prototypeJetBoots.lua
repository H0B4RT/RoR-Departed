Order Details:

Hey [REDACTED], these are the prototype jet boots we've been working on. Same as last time: take them out for a ride, test the output, blah blah blah. Please tell us if anything goes wrong.

Also, please remember not to press the blue component that sticks out on the back: we don't want any more accidents...

Hopefully, we can get that fixed and reinforced on the next revision. I don't know yet, [REDACTED] is still busy solving the battery problem. 

We're already running out of time so please send us your log ASAP.
