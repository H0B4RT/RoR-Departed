Order Details:

Biggest snowflake, to date. Technically, it isn't a snowflake, it's just a chunk of ice, but STILL. That's hard to sell as a museum piece. Anyways, the thing is hard as rock; I got drunk one day and dropped it on the floor, and it went right through, so don't worry about transportation.
