Order Details:

Designed to detonate directly on impact and disorient targets. Fires pellets intended for stunning, not for killing! SWAT teams will love these, but any men you have on the field should use fragmentation grenades instead.

Pull the pin and throw in the general direction of the bad guys. If you can't figure it out, you deserve to get hurt.
