Order Details:

Guys, remember the tiny guy I sent over some time ago? Well, this one is a bit more aggressive. Although she is a funny little gal! She loves spinnin around and watching me from inside the jar. Man, if I hadn't rescued her, she would be in some alien stomach right now.
I kinda want to name her Ann, thoughts?
