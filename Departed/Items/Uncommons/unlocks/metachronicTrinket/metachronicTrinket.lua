Order Details:

"Time is the most valuable resource in the universe", my mother used to say. But the more I spend with this, the more I realize how wrong she was, and how naive I've been.

Maybe nothing is what we think it is. Our quest for knowledge could be in vain, but there's one thing I can tell you:

Time echoes your name.
