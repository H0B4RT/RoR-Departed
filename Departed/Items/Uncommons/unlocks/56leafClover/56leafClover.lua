Order Details:

A FIFTY-FREAKIN-SIX leaf clover! It was sent to me from a fan, picked from the top of Mount Drummond. It lived through the mountain fire; imagine that! I'm keeping it in observation to make sure it doesn't wilt; this is a once in a lifetime specimen! Think of all the elixirs we could make.. I may use a few of them myself and go hit the lottery!
