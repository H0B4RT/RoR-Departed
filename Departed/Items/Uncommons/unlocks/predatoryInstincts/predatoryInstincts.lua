Wolves. Nasty creatures. Was tendin' my crops, then a pack of 'em come out. I thought the mine field finished them all off, but the big guy, the alpha dog, was still around. Came RIGHT after me. Gut the thing right then and there. The hunter is now the hunted, eh? You ain't sayin much anymore, are ya?
