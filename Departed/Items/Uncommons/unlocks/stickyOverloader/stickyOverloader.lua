Order Details:

So you're telling me they took a literal BOMB and reengineered it into a throwable BATTERY? HOW DO THESE THINGS RELATE?! I'm not even going to try and use it, you can't just use a battery like that. It's asking for chaos.

I don't blame them, they're jerks, but [REDACTED]... really? It's widely known that contact energy transfers need to be stable for them to fundamentally work.

If this is considered, stable then call me a pig and watch me fly.
