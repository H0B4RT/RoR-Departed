Relics are basically the Starstorm version of lunars and are being ported over to Departed via the Starstorm DLC.
There will be brand new relics and all existing relics from Starstorm 1 will be added.
They will still only appear on Stage 5 during Classic Runs, but will show up in Judgement and Survival as well (if you know where to look.)

Here is a sneak peak of a new relic that MIGHT added to Departed (will most likely be reworked):

Relic of Purity:
All cooldowns are reduced by 33%, but health regeneration and healing is reduced by 50%.
