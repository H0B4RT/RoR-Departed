Field Notes:
Characterized by their constant flame, the Wisps are not living beings. Each Wisp has a mask in its center, where all the fire erupts from. The Wisps are able to concentrate their heat into a long range heat blast, capable of scorching anything in its path. On taking heavy damage, the fuel powering the Wisp detonates, sending the mask soaring clear through the air.

How they function is a mystery to me. While I've seen 'deactivated' masks all around this world, the only time I've spotted Wisps is around me, as if someone creates them specifically to kill me..
