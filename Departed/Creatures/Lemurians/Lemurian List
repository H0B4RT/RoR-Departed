Enemies: Lemurian, Elder Lemurian, Evolved Lemurian, Lemurian Calvary
Boss: Ancestral Lemurian
Special Boss: Direseeker

Lemurians, Elder Lemurians, Evolved Lemurians, and the Lemurian Calvary are all based on their Risk of Rain Returns appearance.
Ancestral Lemurians are a new boss enemy made by yours truly and serves as a late game boss, perhaps stage 5 and later.
Additionally, Ancestral Lemurians can appear later on on the backs of domesticated Toxic Beasts. They act like a combination of the Ancestral Lemurian, Toxic Beast, and Lemurian Calvary.
Also also, Direseeker.
