Field Notes:
With these around, darkness isn't my main concern. Not quite because of their vigorous light, but rather their obsessive, incessant interest in living beings. I'm still not entirely sure how could a species evolve to resemble... a lamp? Is it even organic?

Of all its quirks, it caught my attention that, the Follower, as I have come to call it, isn't aggressive towards me. That is, unless there is no other kind of creature around it can follow. Despite being a light source, it is no guide. Just a follower.
