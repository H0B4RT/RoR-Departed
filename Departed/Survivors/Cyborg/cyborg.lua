Cyborg
Key Notes
	- STARSTORM CONTENT
	- The CYBORG is VERSATILE and very TIME EFFICIENT. Both the UNMAKER and OVERHEAT REDRESS allow you to achieve GREAT DAMAGE OUTPUT. RISING STAR allows for PRECISE ELIMINATIONS, useful when CONTENDERS are out of reach. CYBORG can create personal portals he can RECALL to, opening the door for THOUSANDS of opportunities.
