Passenger Details:
[Civilian Class]


Luggage & Equipment:
Passenger boarded with a modified CronTech cybernetic enhancement suit. Attached 'projectile launchers' have been welded in places and could not be removed by security personnel, so temporary electrical auto-nullifiers have been attached until landing. Individual also checked 4 large anti-ballistic crates into the loading bay, which showed heavy machinery in the preliminary security x-rays. Crates marked as containing 'de-activated security turrets', 'anti-personnel hardware', and a 'large experimental fission array'. All associated batteries were removed and stored in adjacent bays in automated lockboxes.


[SECURITY RECALL]
[Event G1] Major blast occured in loading bay 4A, originating from the individual's largest crate, causing an automated lockdown which had to be manually resolved. Container shifted into bay 4B and placed behind all of the passenger's other loaded cargo.
[Event G2] Passenger walked too close to generator room, causing applied electrical auto-nullifiers to suddenly remagnetize. Personnel summoned to remove passenger from door.
