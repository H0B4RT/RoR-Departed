Log:
Strange how still it is here. The waves barely make a sound, and these broken ruins scattered along the shore hint that someone else tried to make this place home once, too. It’s almost peaceful, in a way. Maybe I can last here a while, learn the tides, maybe even find something to eat inland. It’s quiet… isolated, sure, but if I’m here for the long haul, I might as well make it livable. 

Not the worst place to land, all things considered.
