Desolate Forest
Title: Ground Zero
Track: Monsoon
Artifact: Honor
Log:
Crashing into a verdant field isn't the worst outcome. I can see lush, rolling hills and strange castles built into mountains. There are foreign species patrolling the grasslands and bizarre housing foundations erected along worn footpaths. I've seen lizards who walk like men and otherworldly stone creatures infused by blazing lights. They seem docile and intelligent, passing by one another with little interaction, but their stiffened postures leave me wary. There's so much culture here for an undocumented planet. There's so much history to these buildings, but their construction doesn't make any sense. Rebar and concrete make up juvenile fabrications, accompanied by worn bricks gathered from ancient castles just meters away. Tree stumps and dead branches litter the landscape as if a forest was felled. But decay settled on this garden long ago... How do you get to concrete before raising a single village? Red sparks dance in the distant sky. I don't know what I'm hoping for.

Dried Lake
Title: Ground Zero
Track: Aurora Borealis
Artifact: Kin
Log:
A massive desert filled with boardwalks and ten-foot crabs. I'm shocked that this is anywhere near the forest I was just in, but I can still see those mountains in the distance - All that greenery traded for dust and skeletons. I would think these catwalks were built to protect from the hot sand below, but these wrecked ships are buried in such shallow dunes. When was there water here? Rain hits my helmet and sizzles at my feet. The overcast sky softens the shadows of petrified barnacles cast over the distant wooden structures. They're held together like old junk in a garage. I can feel the planks bow under my weight, but I'd rather take my chances than wade through a muddy sea of claws and mandibles.

Damp Caverns
Title: Fungal Haven
Track: Cyclogenesis
Artifact: Distortion
Log:
I'm launched into darkness. The bioluminescence is fighting with the pitch black of the caverns, and I can barely make out cliffs and valleys alongside these enormous mushrooms. Some younger ones toddle around and release dense gas clouds, but I've yet to see any individuals who have grown beyond my height. I'm cautious to touch the stalks of any of these towering masses should I find one, so I'm left creeping through the dark bellows towards the next pronged portal. The earth's rotten constitution leaves the ground pillowy. Distant sinkholes above me dot the ceiling like stars. It'd be nice, if it weren't for the constant excretions pouring around my boots. And the rotten stench. I can't even hold my nose.

Sky Meadow
Title: Field of Sprites
Track: Chanson D'automne
Artifact: Spite
Log:
I wonder how these landmasses stay afloat? I can't feel any gravitational abnormalities here, even when I'm beneath them. So far this planet has felt like walking on Mars, nothing would've indicated this as a possibility. After falling asleep on an isolated peninsula, I was shocked to wake up with company. Stone statues of hooded figures had surrounded me silently while I slept. No drag marks, no footsteps, no sound. Except there was a sound - a faint hum resonating between them. After a few minutes of stillness, I rose to my feet. I reached out to push them aside and the humming stopped.

Ancient Valley
Title: Frozen Tundra
Track: Aurora Borealis
Artifact: Glass
Log:
This bridge just goes on forever... but at least it _is_ a bridge. Between this blizzard and the mountain fog I can't see more than two meters ahead, even with my mounted lights. I know I haven't accidentally turned around because the stampede keeps rumbling in the distance behind me, though I'm starting to wonder if its just the wind against the crumbling cliffsides. There's scorched steel strewn along the road, still smoking. What kind of fire could burn in a place like this? I'll have to clamber down to the exposed access tunnels running underneath the bridge to rest, though I can't tell if the drop below is 10 meters or 10 miles.

Boar Beach
Title: Simpler Times
Track: Aurora Borealis
Artifact: None
Log:
Through some brambles and fencing I've come across a clearing in the fog. A big bang dropped me from my perch as boars rampaged, weaving in and out of the iron rebar collected from the endless bridge. The spikes were organized into patterns, almost like farm pens, and the pigs each took turns collecting dirt and piling it between them. Beyond that was a barren circle formed from repeated stomping in the tundra. Two boars were fighting within, but one dressed in a shirt appeared to be dancing between the other's attacks, as if it had years of experience.

Sunken Tomb
Title: Underwater Catacombs
Track: 25 3°N 91 7°E
Artifact: Enigma
Log:
It's hard to tell how deep these catacombs go. I don't have enough oxygen to explore more deeply. Murals describing some kind of war or migration are etched into the walls, though the water pressure must've torn them apart years ago. I can make out figures riding ships - it's hard to tell and I imagine any species that would build a tomb this deep underwater wouldn't require them. The sarcophagi lining the halls ring hollow and the tables and pots look untouched like some sort of nuclear shelter, frozen in time. The ceilings in here are so high and have skylights dug out from the earth above. The caustics are beautiful on the old stonework, though I don't see how they intended for the sun dial below to serve its purpose.

Magma Barracks
Title: The Core
Track: Tropic of Capricorn
Artifact: Sacrifice
Log:
It's hot. My suit can't regulate temperatures like these. I can see waterfalls of lava flowing from grand battlements above me feeding into lakes of magma. The giant turtles below seem quite fond of it, though the surrounding Lemurians seem to have built great steel pens to cage them in. I've caught glimpses of the tribes ferrying back and forth atop their ashen shells almost as frequently as I've seen sacrifices made to feed them. These walkways between the watch towers are calm for now, but the amount of weapons strewn about are concerning. I can hear the clanking of workshops ahead. The only way left is up from here. A mile or so above me I can see the roots of a great tree with battlements spiraling towards it. Maybe I won't need to take a portal this time?

Hive Cluster
Title: Deep Undergrowth
Track: Chanson D'automne
Artifact: Command
Log:
It's hard to tell whats alive and what isn't down here. The fibrous membranes that line the walls are sticky like fresh sap, and its difficult to avoid stepping on gestating pustules wherever you go. I'm stuck hanging from this flesh-rope for now. It's either waiting for these orange beasts to leave or upsetting the hive with more gunfire. At least this time I'm smelling strawberries instead of rot, but the sweet siren's call isn't doing much when I can see skeletons inside this thing. I can feel a slight crawling sensation around my hands and the heat pulses from these fibers like some kind of sick womb. I heard what sounded like crying a moment ago, but it's stopped since then. It was probably my imagination, the constant buzzing is as deafening as it is frightening.

Temple of the Elders
Title: Holy Ground
Track: Artic Oscillation
Artifact: Spirit
Log:
A vast hole of clouds swirls along the lip of this massive floating ridge. Towers and churches are constructed with windows and archways all standing with reverence toward the center of the miles-wide gap. A sort of vortex sucks the air downward and I can see flocks of birds dancing in the wind, like some sort of ritual. The sun touches these stones like nowhere else and a massive spire echoes into the sky, piercing the clouds only to be swallowed again before reaching the atmosphere. It has to have been a thousand steps climbed by now, with the corpses piling up in the nave below. Thunder roars down this spiral, with red lightning flashing shadows of future combatants against the walls. From this height I can finally see it: The Contact Light.

Risk Of Rain
Title: UES Contact Light
Track: Coalescence
Artifact: Origin
Log:
//-c o m m a n d   l o g  0 1 
UES Class-D Ship 'Contact Light' is capable of carrying 8 million standard-load crates in a single voyage. Freight containers of varying sizes can be magnetized to its cargo hold, with rotational drums stabilizing any disturbances that may occur during space travel. With 50 years of shipments under its wing, it's still a relatively juvenile freighter within the D Suite. Recent restructuring has caused shipment schedules to be rotated among the lesser ships. With half of Class-A ships out of commission due to [REDACTED], the 'Contact Light' has been chosen to deliver [REDACTED]'s previously scheduled cargo. A new captain has been assigned to oversee the journey, and we have placed agents on-board for security reasons. Godspeed.

The strongest biological healing agent.. is a mushroom. Found in an abandoned house. I find some humor in that.
This fungus has developed an amazing defense mechanism of hiding underground when bothered, allowing it to live long enough to distribute spores.

Can be either ground into a paste or.. planted directly into the wound. A small warning; you'll feel it enter you, and it is every bit as unpleasant as it sounds.

This egg seems to be somewhere between hatching and dying. Leaving it undisturbed usually causes it to wiggle around a bit, maybe sticking a tendril out. Trying to remove it from its shell is greeted by the most horrible screetching!

I can't bring it to myself to cook it alive. I don't know what to do with it, so here you go; maybe it will hatch in a warmer climate like yours. As useless as he is, I have grown a bit fond of him. Please take care!

Well, uh.. it's a little outdated. You stick explosives down the end, then you fire the explosive. With more explosives. If you're trying to reduce your injury rate, don't use these.

Other than its archaic design, the mortar tube is actually pretty decent if you get a lot of them in a battery. Can blanket a big area, like [REDACTED]. I suppose you can beat them with the tube afterwards.

Leeching Seed
Shipping Details:
  Tracking Number: 1461***********

Order Details:

These seeds are recently germinating, so be quick! These flesh-infesting pods seem to burrow, balloon, and then pop in a few months. Most test patients have.. died. However, before they die, they feel increased health and state of mind!
In fact, the pods themselves seem to develop spores, which if collected can be turned into a pain reliever..

Find a way to stop its growth cycle at that state, and you have yourself a great healing agent.

Prison Shackles
Shipping Details:
  Tracking Number: 1463***********

Order Details:

An artifact from the old ages, before we used holo-cuffs. The advantage is that EMP blasts and remote-hacking can't disable good-old steel and chains. Fitting this on larger prisoners may be harder.
I know you guys have been having a serious break-out problem in the last few months, and this is sure to throw those prison breakers for a loop. Just don't lose the key.

We are shipping about.. 500, because we have nothing better to do with them than smelt them for steel, which is barely worth more than dirt this day and age. Would probably cost more than getting rid of them.

Our lab is about finished with this. We agreed that without additional funding, we'd have to ship it back out to complete the project - so here it is. The fields are a bit unstable currently without additional shielding, and the sample you provided was less than ideal, but I would say given the test results we're operating at at least 75% of the efficiency goal. I would recommend that you find a sample with less copper impurities, less than 50 ppm to reach optimal results.

A glowing scepter, with a name engraved in the handle. I can't read with it says; I was hoping you could decipher it. It must have some magical powers; look at how impressive it is! It's much better than your Lance of Legends, that's for sure.

And before you ask, yes, the handle is supposed to be hard to hold. Culls the weak.

This horrid bottle fills me with fear. I can see the reflections in the glass of things that are not there.

It's been only three days but I can't sleep with the sound of clacking and rattling occupying my dreams. Give it to someone else for safekeeping, I don't care about the job.

Hey boss, in the crate you should find a couple of the artifacts from our last dig in that secret room. You should see 5 items, we stored them in foam. Should be an ornamental shield, some kind of shortsword or dagger, half of a crown, and two shreds of some kind of stiff fabric. Be careful handling the fabric, feels like it could crumble with just slight pressure. The shield must be hollow or something, it's unusually light. I know you are, but be extra careful with it. Don't let the students even breathe on it.

So here is a prototype of the disposable missile launcher you requested. The box itself is made of cardboard, which raises some safety issues but also lowers the production costs immensely.

While intended for anti-artillery use, the ONI-CV117 has become wildly popular in the private sector as both a personal and automobile defence device. By protecting the user in 'hard light' that closely wraps around, shock is absorbed throughout the light, rather than by the user. However, the shield generator requires time to charge, meaning it has a short uptime. Time it wisely.

Lost manual for HAN-D bot. We've had it around for a long time, I don't see any reason to update to a new model. I think most of the crew have grown attached to the big guy, the way its eye lights up and chirps almost makes you think it's friendly. Anyway, if you were referred to this note by me or someone else, all you need to know is to oil its joints once a month and don't get in its way when its in 'hallway duty' mode, because it can get aggressive with the mop. Keeps the place clean though.  Also I think something in the old manual referred to replacing the solar battery, but batteries for the old model tend to be hard to find.  We'll figure it out if he doesn't wake up someday.

Passenger Details:
[Civilian Class]


Luggage & Equipment:
Passenger boarded with a modified CronTech cybernetic enhancement suit. Attached 'projectile launchers' have been welded in places and could not be removed by security personnel, so temporary electrical auto-nullifiers have been attached until landing. Individual also checked 4 large anti-ballistic crates into the loading bay, which showed heavy machinery in the preliminary security x-rays. Crates marked as containing 'de-activated security turrets', 'anti-personnel hardware', and a 'large experimental fission array'. All associated batteries were removed and stored in adjacent bays in automated lockboxes.


[SECURITY RECALL]
[Event G1] Major blast occured in loading bay 4A, originating from the individual's largest crate, causing an automated lockdown which had to be manually resolved. Container shifted into bay 4B and placed behind all of the passenger's other loaded cargo.
[Event G2] Passenger walked too close to generator room, causing applied electrical auto-nullifiers to suddenly remagnetize. Personnel summoned to remove passenger from door.

SUBJECT #c25058
Early genetic experimentation has led to the creation of larger creatures from test tubes in recent months. Entirely coded in-house, with no DNA baseline larger than 5% of any one pre-existing Adam subject, this creature that we have code-named 'ACRID' has shown more intelligence than any other baseless chimaera and almost as much intelligence as [redacted] chimaeras. Preliminary tests on the subject have been occuring for months now. It is genetically stable but displays erratic signs of violence, and is thus being shipped to your unit for further trials due to safety concerns. The crate is rated for biological weapon resistance, but is not recommended for animal use - Still, we believe Acrid should make it to you safely and we have no concerns of damage in transit due to the immense strength and resilience it has shown across multiple trial periods.

P.S. Good Luck.

Creatures





Lemurian
Health: 100
Damage: 14
Speed: 22 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall, Climb
Field Notes:
The first sentient species I discovered on my unfortunate arrival. Around 7' tall, with scaly skin not different from that of a lizard. Bipedal. Aggressive on sight, minus a few exceptions. These Lemurians have an extremely powerful bite, but don't seem to employ weapons.

All species that I have encountered have armor on their shoulders and wrists, indicating a high intelligence. They seem to live in underground tunnels networked all over the planet, and can use these tunnels to ambush prey.

From what I've briefly seen, they seem to enjoy song and dance.



Stone Golem
Health: 300
Damage: 34
Speed: 10 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
Now THEY are interesting. These Golems, which tower over me at 10' tall, are constructed from the soil and rock beneath my feet. After a brilliant red flash, the earth itself moves to create these constructs in 2 seconds flat. If I didn't know better, I would consider this.. magic.

Because of their material, they are extremely tough to take down. Using the same technology that constructs them, the Rock Golems are capable of creating a 'clap' which generates great amounts of energy. Damaging a golem eventually causes it to malfunction and die, returning to the ground.

Despite their powerful combat abilities, the golems are gentle to everybody but me, and can be seen 'playing' with wildlife.



Sand Crab
Health: 300
Damage: 34
Speed: 22 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
A few hours after my crash, I finally decided to investigate the nearby area. As I moved past a particularly large mound of sand, it began to shift and roar. From it erupted a giant crab-like beast, standing above me at 10' with claws the size of a small man. The giant crab moves surprisingly fast for its size; the foliage growing on its back indicates that they stay still for long periods of time. This crab is either extremely patient or hibernates regularly.

After exhausting my supplies in taking it down, I salvaged what meat I could. Very chewy, but not unpleasant. Looking across the beach, I spot many similar mounds of sand. I must keep moving; daylight is coming.



Lesser Wisp
Health: 170
Damage: 17
Speed: 27 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
Characterized by their constant flame, the Wisps are not living beings. Each Wisp has a mask in its center, where all the fire erupts from. The Wisps are able to concentrate their heat into a long range heat blast, capable of scorching anything in its path. On taking heavy damage, the fuel powering the Wisp detonates, sending the mask soaring clear through the air.

How they function is a mystery to me. While I've seen 'deactivated' masks all around this world, the only time I've spotted Wisps is around me, as if someone creates them specifically to kill me..



Greater Wisp
Health: 470
Damage: 23
Speed: 27 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
Oh lord. These.. Greater Wisps, as I have grown to call them, are absolutely terrifying to face. Tougher then the Rock Golem, faster then the Lemurian, and harder hitting then both combined. Unlike the lesser Wisps, the Greater Wisp has two arms capable of typical motion. They burn a brilliant green which pierces straight though my sun visor.

Their combat abilities are unprecedented; I can be clear 200m away, and they still manage to hit me square in the chest. I must stay hidden.. before they find me again.



Jellyfish
Health: 85
Damage: 7
Speed: 40 KM/H
Mobility: Fly
Field Notes:
An airborne creature, capable of flight using a combination of gases in its clear hull. Like the Jellyfish on earth, they also use pulsation to aid in locomotion; however, rather than a series of tentacles, they have two branches' made of many tentacles wrapped around themselves.

Also like the Jellyfish, they have quite the sting, capable of penetrating my weather shielding. The same gases used for flight are used to create a very powerful electrostatic charge.



Trokk
Health: 300
Damage: 18
Speed: 15 KM/H
Mobility: Teleport
Field Notes:
While resting in the shade of a massive tree, I was startled at what I thought was an earthquake. The ground shifted beneath my feet and I was suddenly thrown into the air. Beneath me was the gaping maw of a Trokk, and if I weren't already gripping my pistol it would've crushed me into sheet metal. Beyond the stone exterior of this strange walking log is some kind of vulnerable flesh like the inside of an alligator's mouth. With no space for a stomach I shudder at the thought of what happens to its victims.



Tuber
Health: 300
Damage: 17
Speed: 29 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall
Field Notes:
The Tuber is reminiscent of the small plants I cared for back on the ship, Nestling themselves deep in the ground, they hide from prey and wait for vibrations to initiate their fanged attack. Like fighting a giant antlion, sometimes the best strategy was to lure them out by tossing spent magazines. I tried stones and other bait, but their responses to the bait seemed dependant on some unseen quality. The behavior of the beasts on the planet continue to concern me I feel like all eyes are on me despite how natural these animals seem from a distance.



Mushrum
Health: 160
Damage: 17
Speed: 22 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
I have arrived in an even stranger land. After recovering from my sudden.. teleportation, I noticed that my suit was flashing warnings about air filtration. All across the landscape were giant fungi, some as tall as trees.

When approaching a large bulbous mushroom, it suddenly sprouted out the ground, jumping a few feet in the air then landing on two nubby feet. At this point my air filtration warning went from yellow to red, and I began to have difficulties breathing..

While sentient, these mushrums were not very intelligent. It had what looked like three eyes, but it could not navigate very well, implying that those may be fake eyes to scare predators. It also had no mouth to eat, but would plant itself over corpses, slowly absorbing nutrients through its root-like feet..



Spitter
Health: 240
Damage: 19
Speed: 18 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
Alas, another hostile creature. This one's nature certainly betrays its precocious appearance. It even seems to be vexed by my retaliation. What a petulant fellow.

His snapping maw hurls orange bile. The acidic mucus must be detonated by the gnashing teeth- conceivably similar to our picric acid. Fascinating, how could this have arisen?

Post-mortem I was able to discover the source of the creature's impressive flexibility. Aside from the skull, mandible, and teeth, the skeleton is highly cartilaginous!



Child
Health: 125
Damage: 14
Speed: 24 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall, Climb
Field Notes:
These small beings fill me with dread.. From a distance I can see them frolicking among the rocks- playing with the other ghostly 'children'. I don't know how else to describe them, they seem so innocent until I approach.

Once I am spotted it as if some wicked switch is flipped and I am their plaything. While I can defeat the small groups, I fear I am only sealing my doom once their small, destroyed bodies are found.



Parent
Health: 315
Damage: 15
Speed: 24 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall
Field Notes:
A deadly force, they rush at me mad with grief and rage. Parents will slam the ground; their only aim to crush the butcher of their offspring. Their powerful blows open great lashes in the quaking ground.

Though my guilt almost stays my hand, I cannot let them keep me from surviving this nightmarish planet. I know it is impossible to quell their fury; so instead I must end it.



Imp
Health: 310
Damage: 13
Speed: 25 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall, Teleport
Field Notes:
Oh. Fear. The Imp causes me fear, with its razor sharp talons and its one eye, locked into mine through my helmet. The Imp uses a propellant to hover above the ground, giving it superior mobility over everything.. including me.

Unlike the other fauna on this planet, the black imp is aggressive to all other species. Is the imp also stranded here? The Black Imp can move from location to location, seemingly instantly. I refuse to believe that the Imp has teleportation; that is for fairy tales and quantum physicists. I won't accept that it can achieve something biologically that the human race couldn't achieve in its entire history.



Clay Man
Health: 140
Damage: 11
Speed: 22 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall, Climb
Field Notes:
Quick with his sword and quicker with his feet; the agility of these clay 'people' is unexpected with a form so roughly shaped.

When faced with one of the few creatures here which I feel some humanity in, my aloneness closes in. Why do they have clay pots on their heads? Could it be protection from the cruel reality, or maybe just to hide the scars from this brutal planet..



Mechanical Spider
Health: 240
Damage: 9
Speed: 27 KM/H
Mobility:
Field Notes:
The malware of our age! These mechanical parasites were probably lurking on the ship before the crash. Pirates will use these bugs to collect especially valuable cargo, redirect transmission signals, or even hijack ships. Spiders can be programmed with all kinds of malicious objectives.

In general they are quite difficult to find and eradicate on large vessels, but now that they're loose they seem to be able to operate outside of their software. They have retained their defense capabilities, and are risky to engange. Though, I wonder, how long will they continue to run without access to an electrical grid?



Bighorn Bison
Health: 430
Damage: 17
Speed: 27
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
The teleporter nearly launched me into a steaming dung heap. I could not have anticipated such an enormous beast being the source. More impressive than their rumbling bellows is the bighorn's charge. Their many tons of muscle produce a crushing slam of horn and matted hair.

When they are not stampeding after me I have observed these monsters using their massive heads to bludgeon rocks and fights amongst themselves. How can they expend so much energy on fruitless activity? Are they merely trying to keep from freezing?



Swift
Health: 105
Damage: 12
Speed: 72 KM/H
Mobility: Fly
Field Notes:
These flying stones manage to stay airborne despite their shale armor. Like a thousand darts thrown from the sun, they dive so swiftly toward me that their beaks slam into the ground. I've yet to see a surface that they cannot puncture, and I'm shocked that their beaks never seem worn. Their predictive aim is troubling, and they seem to know where I'm headed before I do. I've witnessed packs of these strange birds circling like vultures in the distant sky, though I've never witnessed any of them scavenging for food. Attempts to fashion their armor into new blades have resulted into nothing but chips in my knife.



Whorl
Health: 230
Damage: 17
Speed: 22 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
Day 8. I was awoken by an abrupt collision of something hard against my suit. A volley of sensors screamed in my ears as a hairline fracture arced across my vision.

The hard shell of a monstrous "Whorl" nearly compromised my air lock. If I hadn't had a small tube of polymer sealant from the astrotrain I would not be recording this now.

These carapaced organisms propel themselves with some form of gas-propulsion. Despite their similar appearance to the nautili of old, they do not use a bellows-like system for locomotion, but a steady streaming of gas through their curling shell. I wonder if this heavy armor prevents them from attaining higher altitudes, constrained to hover among the land creatures.



Macrobe
Health: 90
Damage: 14
Speed: 32 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall
Field Notes:
Sinking into an endless lake, I was caught off-guard by these huge cellular beasts. Bounding towards me, I can almost identify their internal anatomy behind thick membranes - How is it possible that some sort of microbe could get this large? Can this really be a single cell? Rough, thorn-like cilia coat its surface and it's flagellum serves as a razor sharp whip. The water doesn't seem to impede it at all, though its strange bouncing behavior may be a result of its attempts to pursue me under heavy water pressure. I'm weary of the force it seems to exert even within these conditions. My oxygen supply can't afford any leaks.



Macrobic Predator
Health: 315
Damage: 16
Speed: 36 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall
Field Notes:
Some kind of massive insect, this creature snaps like a viper and skitters like an ant. It shouldn't be possible at such a scale to move so abruptly and yet it does. Similar to the Macrobe, this monster is some kind of predatory cell. With a massive rope of nerves at its core, I can only image it acts on instinct alone. I dug into a corpse to see if the spinal rope could sustain me in this toxic hive, but I found my arms stuck to the thick membrane and I had to use my knife to remove the non-newtonian gel. It'd make a great trap for prey, but I don't have time to test that theory.

Gup
Health: 375
Damage: 27
Speed: 25 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall
Field Notes:
Field Notes:
It is quite rare that I smell anything through my respirator. I could not have been prepared for how bizarre no longer having a sense of smell is. However, there have been a rare few occasions when I caught some trace aroma- generally somewhat bitter on this planet, but I savor them greedily.

When I encountered this gelatinous beast I was assailed by a sweet smell! A strangely fruity scent.. Oh, how it brings me back to a more innocent time! As I struck the congealed blimp of a creature it divided and seemed to gain energy. With each blow more of the saccharine odor escaped the monster. I must admit, I may have been overzealous in my attack..

Evolved Lemurian
Health: 125
Damage: 14
Speed: 54 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall, Fly
Field Notes:
Could this be a distant cousin of the Lemurians below? An ancient evolutionary leap? These airborne reptiles do not interact with the ground Lemurians except to harass them occasionally. Perhaps there is some kind of natural feud between the species?

It is the membranous skin that attaches their long arms to their body which enables their flight. Each wingtip culminates in vicious talons. When they come in flocks these winged Lemurians are capable of great carnage.



Elder Lemurian
Health: 405
Damage: 23
Speed: 18 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall
Field Notes:
Seems to be very large version of the Lemurians; perhaps this great lizard is a queen? With similar armor and much thicker skin, it took much more to bring down this foe. She moves much slower and posses a powerful scorching blast.

I would willingly give up some of my dwindling rations to explore the Lemurian tunnels unnoticed. My mind envisions great communal caverns and many spectacular subterranean dwellings. Do great legions of Lemurians walk under my feet?



Lemurian Calvary
Health: 200
Damage: 17
Speed: 268 KM/H
Mobility: Jump
Field Notes:
I found a group of red Lemurians resting in the dilapidated ruins with domesticated boars alongside them. I've never seen a red species outside of the flying types, though I doubt these are any more welcoming. With great spears and flamboyant helmets, they resemble cavalry of times past, and I'm not equipped to face any chariots head-on. In the distance I can see two of them sparring atop their beasts. They attack with sharp agility and acrobatic prowess that I hope to never experience.



Temple Guard
Health: 420
Damage: 17
Speed: 15 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
A robot creature that assembles itself.. I have not seen them materialize other than when I unknowingly trigger their presence. I cannot believe this is indeed a machine- and yet it is made from some alloy and uses heavy artillery! Was this on the ship, or are these guards a naturally occuring 'species' here? My suit's scanners are unable to detect any manufacturer's signature.

They seem to be determined not to let me pass. They attack with unlimited focus.



Archer Bug
Health: 82
Damage: 6
Speed: 36 KM/H
Mobility: Fly
Field Notes:
Such aggravating creatures! These insects come in droves- as a group their wings create a maddening whine. Even the other creatures seems disturbed by their presence. Though they are not particularly strong, the circling insects certainly frustrate me.

A small amount of their projectile spit managed to penetrate one of the layers of my suit. It was extremely caustic. A festering rash has formed in the area, but doesn't seem to be spreading.



Bramble
Health: 300
Damage: 10
Speed: 18 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
While walking through overgrown ruins I found myself surrounded by strange rustling that I could not place. Stepping into a massive temple, vines whipped the entryway shut and the ivy began slithering down the walls. These living Brambles spit caustic venom and I'm thankful to only have holes left in my gloves. Their hypnotic sway distills fear in me and I recognize some higher intelligence in their movements. The bark at their base facilitates some kind of locomotions, though I can't identify any apparant muscular system inside that would drive it. After the encounter, the resulting coughs and spasms left me on edge as I scaled the tower and left the echoes behind me.



Tiny Imp
Health: 22
Damage: 3
Speed: 24 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall
Field Notes:
I seem to have found the one creature on this planet that DOESN'T want to kill me. These small, leathery creatures are spawned from vases I sometimes spot in the ruins. They seem to stay in packs, and frequently carry useful treasure.

Immediately after spawning, these tiny imps run in all directions. While I do feel a bit.. awful.. about killing what seems to be the equivalent of children, I need the treasure they hold if I'm to survive. I'm sorry.



Lynx Tribe
Health: 160
Damage: 14
Speed: 27 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall, Climb
Field Notes:
I glanced to one side, trying to get my bearings. By sheer luck, my eyes picked up something barely visible, so still it could be mistaken for a rock. A shiver ran down my spine as I realized it was alive. I hadn't heard anything approach; how long had it been watching me? Why hadn't it attacked me? I suppose the creature had never seen anything like me. As we exchanged gazes, I noticed there were more of them. Gripped by fear, I shot a glance at my firearm which, in my hubris, was still in its holster. A twig snapped, and I immediately looked back to them, but they were gone. I walk slowly now. There could be one of these behind every blade of grass.



Colossus
Title: Giant Stone Guardian
Health: 1400
Damage: 40
Speed: 20 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
A low groaning, lasting for a few days at least. From the relative safety of my drop pod I watched as a mountain rose to its knees, pushing itself up with arms of stone and dirt and twine.

The Colossus appears as a cousin of the Rock Golem and share many similarities, from its red gaze to its stocky stature. Around its feet many smaller golems rose, joining it. In what possible ways could conventional weapons help Me?

I've begun to find a dark humor in the absolute overkill that I face. This is simply ridiculous.



Wandering Vagrant
Title: Gentle Protector
Health: 1400
Damage: 12
Speed: 24 KM/H
Mobility: Fly
Field Notes:
Day 3. While looking through some wreckage of the old ship, I felt a hot sensation on my skin and a brilliant white flash. Over the horizon maybe 5 miles north I saw it, looming over the forest tops.

It must be the size of a house, this thing. A massive variant of the jellyfish seen earlier; this behemoth hovers in the air, searching for something. The gas used to propel this beast bend the trees below it flat. When it spotted its prey, it sent out six bioluminescent orbs, all crashing towards the ground and incinerating the target.

This Vagrant, as I've come to call it, seems to wander amidst the skies, followed by many jellyfish. On the occasion the clouds part, I swear I sometimes see hundreds of vagrants up there. What are they looking for?



Magma Worm
Title: Ancient Lava Swimmer
Health: 1400
Damage: 55
Speed: 268 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
I've stumbled upon an old relic, notably with two distinct stone prongs. On approaching it it whirred to life, apparantly charging up. This seemed to disturb something deep and violent below the ground..

The Magma Worm exploded out of the ground, knocking me off my feet. While I struggled with shell shock, I saw it arc through the sky, then plunge back into the ground with another bang.

Reaching about.. 200 meters, the worm moves extremely fast for its size. Permanently burning out of pores in its skin, the Magma Worm uses this flame as both a hunting tool and a way to melt through the ground quickly. Its small, beady eyes lurch around, looking for prey. With its massive size, the Magma Worm must either eat VAST amounts of food a day or hibernate for a very, very, very long time below ground.



Ancient Wisp
Title: Banished And Chained
Health: 1470
Damage: 23
Speed: 18 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
Could this be the architect of the smaller wisps? Perhaps this Ancient Wisp is the puppeteer behind the fiery masks harassing me thus far, or is he also a devilish device of something greater..?

The heat coming off the purple flames is extreme. Ferocious columns of lightning threaten to short-out my suit, or worse, turn me into a blistered husk. What fuels these violent, burning apparitions?



Lynx Totem
Title: Nkuhana's Faithful
Health: 1210
Damage: 14
Speed: 18 KM/H
Mobility: Jump
Field Notes:
Travelling through the fungal caverns, I kept seeing out of place rubble that trailed to nowhere. With no buildings in sight, I was shocked to see a brick wall in the distance. Little cat-like creatures with masks and weaponry danced around the structure, and I could hear them laugh with one another. They appeared to be practicing some kind of worship, though the structure looked unlike anything I've seen on this planet. More of them crawled out from the dirt nearby, but strangely I haven't seen any evidence of them resting or hiding in the soil prior to that. Luckily they were distracted - I don't know that I could take on a horde of that size, no matter how small they were.



Imp Overlord
Title: Lord of the Red Plane
Health: 1210
Damage: 27
Speed: 27 KM/H
Mobility: Jump, Fall
Field Notes:
Oh, why me? My heart stopped when this great Imp manifested in previously empty space. So many horrendous eyes. With a gaping scream the Imp lets out a deadly red vapor. Some type of laser also trails me.

This demon is just as baffling in its movement as the smaller one. Barely escaping the Imp's whipping grasp I landed a final blow. Its dying body split open at its meridian, displaying its innards like some ghastly flower. This monster is just as gruesome in death as it was in life.



Ifrit
Title: Scion of the Infernal King
Health: 1500
Damage: 17
Speed: 45 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
Could this be..? Tales I never believed recounted a horrible beast, fire incarnate. Scourge of another solar system, the Ifrit nearly wiped out an entire space colony before being chained and launched into the great black void. Supposedly the flaming jets that accompanied his roars could be seen for days as he drifted outwards.

Great towers, what must have been the containment structure used to trap this monster, prevent his escape even on this forsaken plane. The only explanation I have for my surviving this legendary encounter is his many years drifting in space and having been fettered in this unforgiving, frozen wasteland.



Toxic Beast
Title: Mother of Many
Health: 1460
Damage: 17
Speed: 33 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
This goliath's body has been carved by this world, covered in numerous scars. The squealing queen had seen many battles. Her coarse hair growing in jagged patches between each old wound only increased her fearsome appearance.

Hot breath from the boar's massive nose fogged up my helmet so badly that it was a marvel I was able to evade her stomping hooves overhead.



Cremator
Title: Shielded Artillery
Health: 1150
Damage: 12
Speed: 45 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
I could not believe my eyes as this creature erupted from the lava. My suit's temperature gauges screeched in warning. How can anything subsist in such heat? The lava parts in waves as the monster swims rapidly through it.

Through craters in the Cremator's thick back armor red hot boulders explode in every direction. The amount of heat and pressure within its body must be a source of immense power. However, its head does not appear as well protected. I pray that it is a source of weakness, for if this leviathan bests me I know there will be no remains left to mark my short existence.



Scavenger
Title: Tasting Your Own Medicine
Health: 1305
Damage: 14
Speed: 22 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
Who knew a pack rat could be so dangerous! This creature seems to be hoarding many of the items littered across this planet. I have seen no others of its kind. If it hadn't been so intent on slaying me I would have tried to gain this Scavenger as an ally..

Will I ever see a friendly face again, or will my last breaths be on this hostile planet?



Providence
Title: Bulwark of the Weak
Health: 9000
Damage: 24
Speed: 22 KM/H
Mobility: None
Field Notes:
I recognized him from the security footage... he was the one who blew the cargo hatches open. He was the one who killed everyone.

Providence, as I came to call him, moved faster and with more purpose than anything else I've seen on this planet. He must command great power, for he seemed to easily control two great gilded wurms of a species similar to the Magma Worm. Is he able to command everyone on this planet? I don't know his purpose, or his reasoning, but he did not give me a choice. I had to kill him... so why do I feel like I made a terrible mistake?

...Why did we have a teleporter from this planet in our cargo hold?
