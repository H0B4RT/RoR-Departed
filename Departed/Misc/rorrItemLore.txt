Just kidding, it's awful. I didn't know it was for petmunk, so I thought I would have a sample. BIG. MISTAKE. If its cubic shape wasn't enough to throw you off, it is grey, smelly, and cold. I have no idea why I ate it. Maybe I'm protein deficient.

The strongest biological healing agent.. is a mushroom. Found in an abandoned house. I find some humor in that.
This fungus has developed an amazing defense mechanism of hiding underground when bothered, allowing it to live long enough to distribute spores.

Can be either ground into a paste or.. planted directly into the wound. A small warning; you'll feel it enter you, and it is every bit as unpleasant as it sounds.

These seeds are recently germinating, so be quick! These flesh-infesting pods seem to burrow, balloon, and then pop in a few months. Most test patients have.. died. However, before they die, they feel increased health and state of mind!
In fact, the pods themselves seem to develop spores, which if collected can be turned into a pain reliever..

Find a way to stop its growth cycle at that state, and you have yourself a great healing agent.

I know you guys have been having a serious break-out problem in the last few months, and this is sure to throw those prison breakers for a loop. Just don't lose the key.

We are shipping about.. 500, because we have nothing better to do with them than smelt them for steel, which is barely worth more than dirt this day and age. Would probably cost more than getting rid of them.

Order Details:

Contains about 500 horse power of torque. Diamond tipped and coated, along with composite steel. Strong enough to pierce the most heavenly of materials.
Can be used for manual drilling, or swap to laser-mode to fire a mining laser instead. The former will wear it out much quicker, but will also have better results.

Why I bother telling you all this is beyond me. You people aren't planning on using it for mining anyways.

Very interesting sample. Found in the egg of an indigenous species in Sector 13. It undergoes mitosis that we all know, but at a much faster rate; about 2140x faster. Obviously can be useful for medicinal purposes.

Make sure to follow the instructions included to keep the sample alive. We have sent it frozen to stop the rapid duplications; since it increases in cell count exponentially, it could very well spiral out of control otherwise.

Thqwibs naturally live in very low atmosphere, so the pressurized container is for their own safety. If released into the room, they'll die immediately, so don't.

I included approximately 30 thqwibs; despite their similar appearance to other creatures, they are naturally social and will become depressed if left alone.

Another one for you folks. You liked the previous shipment so much, I thought I would send you more outdated tech. When I say outdated, I MEAN outdated. This thing triggers from plunging; while it still uses microwave signals to connect between sticks of dynamite, it is otherwise the same as the classics.

Order Details:

While intended for anti-artillery use, the ONI-CV117 has become wildly popular in the private sector as both a personal and automobile defence device. By protecting the user in 'hard light' that closely wraps around, shock is absorbed throughout the light, rather than by the user. However, the shield generator requires time to charge, meaning it has a short uptime. Time it wisely.
