We've had it around for a long time, I don't see any reason to update to a new model. I think most of the crew have grown attached to the big guy, the way its eye lights up and chirps almost makes you think it's friendly. Anyway, if you were referred to this note by me or someone else, all you need to know is to oil its joints once a month and don't get in its way when its in 'hallway duty' mode, because it can get aggressive with the mop. Keeps the place clean though.  Also I think something in the old manual referred to replacing the solar battery, but batteries for the old model tend to be hard to find.  We'll figure it out if he doesn't wake up someday. -DO NOT REMOVE HAN-D FROM SHIP. Took YEARS to calibrate!

All associated batteries were removed and stored in adjacent bays in automated lockboxes. [SECURITY RECALL] [Event G1] Major blast occured in loading bay 4A, originating from the individual's largest crate, causing an automated lockdown which had to be manually resolved.

Try to stun targets inside your Caustic Sludge for maximum damage. Remember that you can fight at both melee and range! ` Shipping Details: SUBJECT #c25058 Early genetic experimentation has led to the creation of larger creatures from test tubes in recent months. Entirely coded in-house, with no DNA baseline larger than 5% of any one pre-existing Adam subject, this creature that we have code-named 'ACRID' has shown more intelligence than any other baseless chimaera and almost as much intelligence as [redacted] chimaeras. Preliminary tests on the subject have been occuring for months now. It is genetically stable but displays erratic signs of violence, and is thus being shipped to your unit for further trials due to safety concerns. The crate is rated for biological weapon resistance, but is not recommended for animal use - Still, we believe Acrid should make it to you safely and we have no concerns of damage in transit due to the immense strength and resilience it has shown across multiple trial periods.
