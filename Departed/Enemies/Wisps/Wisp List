Enemies: Lesser Wisp, Greater Wisp, Archaic Wisp
Boss: Ancient Wisp

The Wisp family will generally act like their Risk of Rain 2 counterparts.
Archaic Wisps will act similarly to their unused version in Risk of Rain 2.
Ancient Wisps will act as a hybrid between their unsused Risk of Rain 2 version and their Returns/Original version.
