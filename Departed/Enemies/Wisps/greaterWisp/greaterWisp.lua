Field Notes:
Oh lord. These.. Greater Wisps, as I have grown to call them, are absolutely terrifying to face. Tougher then the Rock Golem, faster then the Lemurian, and harder hitting then both combined. Unlike the lesser Wisps, the Greater Wisp has two arms capable of typical motion. They burn a brilliant green which pierces straight though my sun visor.

Their combat abilities are unprecedented; I can be clear 200m away, and they still manage to hit me square in the chest. I must stay hidden.. before they find me again.
