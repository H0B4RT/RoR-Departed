Log:
Field Notes:  
What I saw, was familiar, it had close resemblance to an old light post, however, it casted a cold, eerie light that felt like the presence of more than what my eyes could perceive.

While possessing what seem to be legs, it doesn't walk. Instead, it hovers over the ground in a very mystical manner.

Other creatures from the planet seem to be comforted around this entity, a kind of comfort that feels as if it had been stripped away from me the very moment I faced this being.
