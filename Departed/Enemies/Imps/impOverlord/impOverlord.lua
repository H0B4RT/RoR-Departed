Field Notes:
Oh, why me? My heart stopped when this great Imp manifested in previously empty space. So many horrendous eyes. With a gaping scream the Imp lets out a deadly red vapor. Some type of laser also trails me.

This demon is just as baffling in its movement as the smaller one. Barely escaping the Imp's whipping grasp I landed a final blow. Its dying body split open at its meridian, displaying its innards like some ghastly flower. This monster is just as gruesome in death as it was in life.
