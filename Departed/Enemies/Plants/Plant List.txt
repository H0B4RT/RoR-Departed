Enemies: Trokk, Tuber, Bramble
Boss: Restless Oak/Leshii

Trokk acts the same but has had a slight redesign. No longer a earthy block but a moss covered log (like I originally thought it was). Acts like RoRR version
Tuber and Bramble act like their RoRR counterparts.
Restless Oak/Leshii acts like its unused counterpart.
