Enemies: Jellyfish, Young Vagrant
Bosses: Wandering Vagrant

Jellyfish and Young Vagrant mimic their Risk of Rain Returns counterparts.
Young Vagrant, however, have been slightly reworked into a late game enemy instead of just showing up on the Contact Light.
Wandering Vagrant has been reworked into a combination of both the Risk of Rain and Risk of Rain 2 versions. Hopefully, this will make the Vagrant a bit more dangerous and fun to fight.
