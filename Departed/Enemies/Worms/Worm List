Enemies: Young Worms
Boss: Magma Worm, Overloading Worm, Volatile Worm

Young Worms are a new late game enemy designed by yours truly. No, they aren't Scorch Worms.
Magma Worms, Overloading Worms, and Volatile Worms will act similarly to their Returns versions but with slight differences and reworks, and are the only regular bosses with one boss item each.
