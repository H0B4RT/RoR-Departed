Log:
I've encountered a new type of Lemurian, far surpassing the others in size and presence. Standing at an imposing height of around 30 feet, these giants are strikingly larger than their counterparts. Their skin is a distinct reddish hue, but what sets them apart is their impressive armamentâ€”they wield large spears and shields with formidable skill.

Despite their massive size, they exhibit a surprising agility, moving with an ease that belies their bulk. Their sheer power and armor make them formidable adversaries, far surpassing even the Elder Lemurians in both strength and defense. 

Could these towering beings be the leaders of the Lemurians?
