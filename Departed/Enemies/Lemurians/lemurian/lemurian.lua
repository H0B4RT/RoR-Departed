Field Notes:
The first sentient species I discovered on my unfortunate arrival. Around 7' tall, with scaly skin not different from that of a lizard. Bipedal. Aggressive on sight, minus a few exceptions. These Lemurians have an extremely powerful bite, but don't seem to employ weapons.

All species that I have encountered have armor on their shoulders and wrists, indicating a high intelligence. They seem to live in underground tunnels networked all over the planet, and can use these tunnels to ambush prey.

From what I've briefly seen, they seem to enjoy song and dance.
