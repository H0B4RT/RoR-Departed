Opuntia
ENDEMIC LIFE
Key Notes
	- They grow on the outskirts of desert areas, can be found near 
	- Stationary, kind of acts like a cactus version of the whomping willow.
	- Opuntia is a succulent member of the plant family. Very territorial, will do a large slam attack with their arm that knocks opponents back.
	- None
	- Before the plant based peeps in returns, I had concepted a plant family for RoR2. There was Caryo (a venus flytrap enemy that would burrow underground and try to snap up opponents), Drosera (a pitcher plant boss that would act as a mortar and launch seedlings that evolve into other plant based enemies if left alone for too long), and finally Opuntia (a cactus enemy that would charge at the player and knock them around). This endemic life creatura is a reference to Opuntia, who was my first ever RoR concept OuO
