Field Notes:
I found a group of red Lemurians resting in the dilapidated ruins with domesticated boars alongside them. I've never seen a red species outside of the flying types, though I doubt these are any more welcoming. With great spears and flamboyant helmets, they resemble cavalry of times past, and I'm not equipped to face any chariots head-on. In the distance I can see two of them sparring atop their beasts. They attack with sharp agility and acrobatic prowess that I hope to never experience.
