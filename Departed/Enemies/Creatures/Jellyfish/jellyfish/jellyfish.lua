Field Notes:
An airborne creature, capable of flight using a combination of gases in its clear hull. Like the Jellyfish on earth, they also use pulsation to aid in locomotion; however, rather than a series of tentacles, they have two branches' made of many tentacles wrapped around themselves.

Also like the Jellyfish, they have quite the sting, capable of penetrating my weather shielding. The same gases used for flight are used to create a very powerful electrostatic charge.
