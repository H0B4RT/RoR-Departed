Where It Appears
Key Notes
	- Endemic life are creatures that aren't typical enemies. They won't go out of their way to attack the player, and rather just exist in an area around the map. They won't respawn when killed, think the Birdsharks on Distant Roost. They are there to provide lore and information about an area. 
	- What stages it appears on
	- How it acts
	- Biological factoids
