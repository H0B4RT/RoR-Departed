Crab
ENDEMIC LIFE
Key Notes
	- Appears on Dried Lake near the edges of the map, appears on Black Beach near the water.
	- A skittish lil crab, implied to be the juvenile version of the Sand Crab. Practically means that this crab grows up INTO Sand Crab, but these small juveniles are far too weak to attack you normally. It also implies that Hermit Crabs are simply juvenile versions of Sand Crabs with a large barnacle on top of them.
	- Walks
