Field Notes:
Now THEY are interesting. These Golems, which tower over me at 10' tall, are constructed from the soil and rock beneath my feet. After a brilliant red flash, the earth itself moves to create these constructs in 2 seconds flat. If I didn't know better, I would consider this.. magic.

Because of their material, they are extremely tough to take down. Using the same technology that constructs them, the Rock Golems are capable of creating a 'clap' which generates great amounts of energy. Damaging a golem eventually causes it to malfunction and die, returning to the ground.

Despite their powerful combat abilities, the golems are gentle to everybody but me, and can be seen 'playing' with wildlife.
