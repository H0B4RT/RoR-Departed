Field Notes:
A low groaning, lasting for a few days at least. From the relative safety of my drop pod I watched as a mountain rose to its knees, pushing itself up with arms of stone and dirt and twine.

The Colossus appears as a cousin of the Rock Golem and share many similarities, from its red gaze to its stocky stature. Around its feet many smaller golems rose, joining it. In what possible ways could conventional weapons help Me?

I've begun to find a dark humor in the absolute overkill that I face. This is simply ridiculous.
