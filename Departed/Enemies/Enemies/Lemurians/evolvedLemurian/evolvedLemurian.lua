Field Notes:
Could this be a distant cousin of the Lemurians below? An ancient evolutionary leap? These airborne reptiles do not interact with the ground Lemurians except to harass them occasionally. Perhaps there is some kind of natural feud between the species?

It is the membranous skin that attaches their long arms to their body which enables their flight. Each wingtip culminates in vicious talons. When they come in flocks these winged Lemurians are capable of great carnage.
