Field Notes:

I should have watched my step. I should have been observant about the moving sand.

It started with the Sand Crabs jittering, clicking their claws in unison, then… a loud groan.

At the bottom of the sand, no rock was to be found. Instead, a chitinous hard surface, slowly lifting me and the remains of a Sand Crab I had to fight. I was no opponent for it. Immense, deceivingly fast, and incomparably tough, my victory was a fluke.

One I surely won’t forget.
