Log:
Field Notes:
Day 3. While looking through some wreckage of the old ship, I felt a hot sensation on my skin and a brilliant white flash. Over the horizon maybe 5 miles north I saw it, looming over the forest tops.

It must be the size of a house, this thing. A massive variant of the jellyfish seen earlier; this behemoth hovers in the air, searching for something. The gas used to propel this beast bend the trees below it flat. When it spotted its prey, it sent out six bioluminescent orbs, all crashing towards the ground and incinerating the target.

This Vagrant, as I've come to call it, seems to wander amidst the skies, followed by many jellyfish. On the occasion the clouds part, I swear I sometimes see hundreds of vagrants up there. What are they looking for?
