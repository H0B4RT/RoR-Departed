# RoR-Departed
risk of rain departed is a risk of rain fangame made to be two things:
1. a low-poly "demake/remake" of Risk of Rain Returns.
2. a celebration of risk of rain and the risk of rain community, having items from all throughout the franchise and items from fan made projects.

----------
# CONTENT:

it should be (once completed) the largest game in the ror franchise (?) having:

over 200 items!

32 survivors, each with 4 variants (128) AND alt skills for each

over 80 enemies, with all the original enemies from RoRR and SS1. also, some new enemies and enemy variants have been added >:]

more final bosses! all can be fought in the same run for the ultimate run. some are completely new >:] (i aint tellin u who they are tho)

# DEVELOPMENT
so far, as of january 29th 2025, development has been goin on for about a year and a quarter. unfortunately, im not going as fast as i would like to but thats kinda just what happens when you have college work and work work to do.

the reason this game is being made is simple: i love risk of rain. i love the risk of rain community. late one night i was thinking to myself, "hey. i really like this game, but i wish there was like... a true 3d version of rorr."
so the idea of Risk of Rain Departed was born! 

its also gotten a lil bit of traction since i last edited the readme, so hopefully it will be worth the wait once it's out in early access.

speaking of early access, i hope to have departed in a playable state by the end of 2026. that will hopefully include a bunch of enemies, survivors, and items. right now its up in the air whether or not early access will have the stage ones planned, but it will have a stage for survival for people to play and mess around on.

# CREDITS & THANKS
i have to give credit to a lot of people who inspired me to AND help me make this project. the @s i will be supplying are the ones on discord!!! (the ones without an @ are kofi)

firstly, i have to thank the two shrimps. neik and swuff. 

i think it was about a year or two before returns was unveiled officially that swuff was making a fan game of risk of rain called risk of rain: first contact and i was like "WOAH i wonder if i could do that." (@en.wikipedia.org)

neik, for the uninformed, is the creator of starstorm 1 (one of the greatest mods i've seen, is practically the iceborne of risk of rain) and is also one of my greatest inspirations when it comes to developing this game. they ALSO have allowed me to port ss1 content to departed, so departed will launch with starstorm items from the get go. thank u again nk! (@eneca)

i also have to thank glasus and redacted.

glasus and redacted have helped me a lot when it comes to balance, art for the game, concept art, skill icons, counsel, and much much more. i couldn't have done this without them. (@glasus and @redacted respectfully)

i also wanna give a special thanks to grey. he has helped me a lot when it comes to balancing, so i feel the need to include him here. (@\_creature_)
