# RoR-Departed
risk of rain departed is a risk of rain fangame made to be two things:
1. A low-poly "demake/remake" of Risk of Rain Returns.
2. A celebration of Risk of Rain and the Risk of Rain community, having items from all throughout the franchise and items from fan made projects.

it should be (once completed) the largest game in the ror franchise (?) having:

over 200 items!

32 survivors, each with 4 variants (128) AND alt skills for each

over 80 enemies, with all the original enemies from RoR1 and SS1. Also, some new enemies and enemy variants have been added >:]

More Final Bosses! All can be fought in the same run for the ultimate run. some are completely new >:]

over 30 stages! (not including alternate game modes)

5 game modes, being:

Classic (The Original Way to Play!)

Survival (Wave Based Roguelike)

Arena (Risk of Rain PVP)

Providence Trials (Fun Little Challenges!)

Safari (Explore Petrichor As an Enemy!)*

And much, much more!

----------

so far, development has been goin on for a little under a year (development started late october of 2023)



the reason this game is being made is simple: i love risk of rain. i love the risk of rain community. late one night i was thinking to myself, "hey. i really like this game, but i wish there was like... a true 3d version of rorr."
so the idea of Risk of Rain Departed was born!

----------

i have to give credit to a lot of people who inspired me to AND help me make this project. the @s i will be supplying are the ones on discord!!! (the ones without an @ are kofi)

firstly, i have to thank the two shrimps. neik and swuff. 
i think it was about a year or two before returns was unveiled officially that swuff was making a fan game of risk of rain called risk of rain: first contact and i was like "WOAH i wonder if i could do that." (@en.wikipedia.org)
neik, for the uninformed, is the creator of starstorm 1 (one of the greatest mods i've seen, is practically the iceborne of risk of rain) and is also one of my greatest inspirations when it comes to developing this game. (@eneca)

i also have to thank glasus and redacted.
glasus and redacted have helped me a lot when it comes to balance, art for the game, concept art, skill icons, counsel, and much much more. i couldn't have done this without them. (@glasus and @redacted respectfully)

also, thank you altzeus!!!
altzeus is helping me out with music for the game (because i like altzeus's music) (@altzeus)

for the people who allowed their concepts to be used for departed, i thank you!
opal has kindly let me use some of its enemies for departed (some of my favorites too!) (@retropacifist)
mysticsword and marwan have allowed me to use black monolith (@themysticsword and marwan6097266)
bee, subwit, and grongo have let me use some of their concepts as well (@_bee_bo_ and @subwit and @grongo123)

also thank you to everyone in the ss1 and redux communities! you have been excellent, friendly people and for that i thank you!
