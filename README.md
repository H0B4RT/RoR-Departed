# RoR-Departed
risk of rain departed is a risk of rain fangame made to be two things:
1. A low-poly "demake/remake" of Risk of Rain Returns.
2. A celebration of Risk of Rain and the Risk of Rain community, having items from all throughout the franchise and items from fan made projects.

# DEVELOPMENT
so far, as of october 3rd 2024, development has been goin on for a little under a year (development started late october of 2023)

the reason this game is being made is simple: i love risk of rain. i love the risk of rain community. late one night i was thinking to myself, "hey. i really like this game, but i wish there was like... a true 3d version of rorr."
so the idea of Risk of Rain Departed was born!
